# Android Scroll Layout  

**Android Scroll Layout** is an Android application built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. This project is inspired by an intermediate-level Android Studio tutorial from [Android Developer Codelabs](https://developer.android.com). It demonstrates how to create scrollable layouts using Jetpack Compose, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.  

## Features  

- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Utilizes modern UI development with Jetpack Compose for a clean and dynamic interface.  
- **Scrollable Layouts**: Implements scrollable columns and rows to handle content that exceeds the screen size.  
- **Smooth Animations**: Ensures smooth scrolling transitions for a better user experience.  
- **State Management**: Leverages Composeâ€™s state management to handle dynamic content and UI updates.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for the app.  
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces.  
- **Android Studio**: The development environment used to build and test the application.
